// it is doing something rather different, so it may as well run in it's own
// process, because with Node.js processes are like threads. If there is a
// problem with discovery, in production, we'll see problems with this process
// and not with the colleague or the procsses it monitors.
//
// It's seperate because it is a seperate utility. It runs in it's own process.
// It uses HTTP because that's our default RPC protocol.

// The chaperon is going to make a best effort get newly booted islanders onto

// bootstrap a new consensus and to tell new participants to join an existing
// consensus. It is not meant to be a consensus alogrithm in itself. It cannot
// make intelligent decisions about all failure cases.
//
// The chaperon polls the discovery end point to get a collection of network
// conduits. It then polls the network conduits to get a collection of
// partipants. It waits for a while to ensure that that the collection of
// participants is stable. It then makes a decision based on what the
// participants have to say for themselves.
//
// If the chaperon cannot get a healthy response from all the network conduits
// then it will not make a decision and instead wait for the network conduits to
// become stable.
//
// We are going to poll every member returned by discovery, so if the list of
// network conduits returned discovery endpoint is missing a conduit, the
// chaperon is going to make a bad decision.

// TODO Split brain is unrecoverable. The Chaperon will detect it. It is an
// unlikely state, it seems, but I'm not certain. It is definately a possiblity
// if the discovery end point returns an incomplete list of network conduits.
// We're probably going to want to look for this state in the logs in case we
// miss it in the chaperon.
//
// TODO Describe the `rejoining` property which will cause the chaperon to halt
// if it the chaperon is either forming a new consensus or if the consensus id
// is not the same as the consensus id indicated by the `rejoining` property.

// TODO Clever word for `uninitialized` which could be instead `booted` or
// `arriving` or something.
